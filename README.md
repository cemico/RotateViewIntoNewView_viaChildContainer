\f0\fs24 \cf0 ## Synopsis\
\
Very simple example of using parent / child handling.  This example replaces the child view controller with another storyboard view controller during a rotation event.  This is a demo app to compare against another demo app which implements this functionality with show / hiding the view, i.e., RotateViewIntoNewView_viaShowHideViews.\
