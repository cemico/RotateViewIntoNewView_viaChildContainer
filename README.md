## Synopsis

Very simple example of using parent / child handling.  This example replaces the child view controller with another storyboard view controller during a rotation event.  This is a demo app to compare against another demo app which implements this functionality with show / hiding the view, i.e., RotateViewIntoNewView_viaShowHideView (https://github.com/cemico/RotateViews_viaShowHideViews).

## Motivation

Explore the differences in handling rotation events which need to render a different storyboard screen.
